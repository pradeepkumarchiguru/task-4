This is my 4th task of sql developer internship.


When analyzing data in a table like your `Flipkart_Mobiles` dataset, you often want to get summaries rather than just looking at every single row. This is where **aggregate functions** come in handy; they take a whole column of numbers and crunch them down into a single useful value, like counting how many mobiles you have, finding their average selling price, or identifying the highest or lowest price. Once you have these summary numbers, you might want to see them for specific categories, not just the entire dataset. This is the job of **`GROUP BY`**, which lets you divide your data into different categories (like grouping all `Samsung` phones together, all `Apple` phones together, and so on, based on the `Brand` column). After you've grouped your data and applied those aggregate functions (for example, finding the average rating for each brand), you might only be interested in certain groupsâ€”perhaps only brands with an average rating above 4.0. For this final step, you use **`HAVING`**, which acts like a filter specifically for these summarized groups, allowing you to narrow down your results based on the aggregated values you just calculated. In essence, you summarize your data, then organize those summaries by categories, and finally filter those categories based on their summarized values.
